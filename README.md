- 👋 Hi, I’m @Wizibeer
- 👀 What is up..? I'm good with numbers and I like solving problems. Technology and progress are the solutions to most problems.
- I'm looking forward to working with many different projects, teams, and people. I hope to get to know you all!
- 🌱 I did recently complete the CompTIA A+ certification, and I'm more predisposed to the hardware aspect. This is more intriguing than networking, and I do look forward to it!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on .., well, anything! I'm new to this and I imagine there's a whole lot out there that it would benefit me to learn. Just looking to get my feet wet for now.
- 📫 How to reach me 7;^z I'd be surprised, honestly, if you didn't already.
